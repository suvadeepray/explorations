-- Haskell Raytracer 
-- 26 Dec 2000
-- adb@tardis.ed.ac.uk

-- A raytracer written in Haskell for scenes consisting of spheres and
-- planes with procedurally defined 3d textures, and a lighting model
-- consisting of diffuse illumination, shadows and reflections (to a
-- fixed depth).  Lights are colored and can be point sources (which
-- cast shadows) or non-occludable directional sources (which don't).
-- Camera and viewing screen can be placed anywhere in the scene, and
-- parallel and perspective projections are provided.

-- To run this, install hugs from www.haskell.org and run it.
-- Type :load Raytrace.hs to load the code and type 'test' to
-- do the raytracing and produce the file c:/test.ppm.

-- Ray tracing details: This is a naive raytracer with no spatial
-- partitioning of the scene (but then again, there's only spheres and
-- planes), no adaptive depth control (fixed depth of 2 currently) or
-- first-hit speedups.  Also, there's only one ray fired per screen
-- pixel (mmm, look at that aliasing). 

-- Haskell details: This is pretty basic Haskell, and probably
-- contains lots of naive coding.  It doesn't use qualified types,
-- monads or higher order types. If, like me, you have the SOE book
-- then everything in this program is explained by the end of chapter
-- 9.  I haven't read any further yet!  Oh, and apologies for the wide
-- code formatting .. emacs fullscreen at 1024x768.

-- Known bugs:
--   * Having lights inside spheres makes for (pretty looking) weirdness

-- I wrote this in a day to learn Haskell.  I was pretty impressed by
-- the speed of development.  Compared to C/C++/Java, you spend much
-- more time thinking about the problem rather than the implementation
-- language.  You don't need to worry about memory management.  Your
-- code isn't littered with detail about *how* to do things (ie. in
-- Haskell you'd use map in places where you'd have a for loop in C,
-- and you don't have to explicitly state the loop variable or the
-- number of iterations).  The strict typechecking and the interpreted
-- nature of hugs means that most errors are flagged quickly.  It
-- doesn't stop you making logic errors though, but it's quite easy to
-- test functions individual to work out what's going wrong (big win
-- for interpreters).  It's pretty concise too (around 160 lines of
-- actual code).  And the performance isn't all that bad.
